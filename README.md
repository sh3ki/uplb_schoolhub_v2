✅ **Role-Based Separation** - Each user role has its own folder structure  
✅ **Easy Maintainability** - Find and update role-specific code quickly  
✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with Inertia/Wayfinder  
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new roles or features  
✅ **Team-Friendly** - Multiple developers can work on different roles simultaneously

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Fixed Issues:
✅ **Section Program Relationship Error** *(Fixed: Feb 10, 2026)*
- Issue: `Call to undefined relationship [program] on model [App\Models\Section]`
- Fix: Updated `Section` model to use `department` and `strand` instead of deprecated `program` relationship

✅ **Schedule Section Relationship Error** *(Fixed: Feb 11, 2026)*
- Issue: `Call to undefined relationship [program] on model [App\Models\Section]` in ScheduleController
- Fix: Changed `Section::with(['program', 'yearLevel'])` to `Section::with(['department', 'yearLevel'])`

✅ **Department Filtering for Portals** *(Fixed: Feb 11, 2026)*
- Issue: Student/Teacher/Parent portals showing wrong department data
- Fix: Student uses Program lookup, Teacher uses teacher record, Parent uses children's programs

✅ **Announcements Not Displaying** *(Fixed: Feb 13, 2026)*
- Issue: Role-targeted announcements not showing for some roles
- Fix: Restored `published_at` condition to allow NULL (immediate publish) and past dates

✅ **Profile Image Not Showing in Dropdown** *(Fixed: Feb 13, 2026)*
- Issue: User dropdown showing initials instead of profile photo
- Fix: Added `avatar` field to shared Inertia auth data from User model's `profile_photo_url` accessor

✅ **Teacher Portal Student/Grade Scoping** *(Fixed: Feb 2026)*
- Issue: Teacher portal was fetching ALL students and grades, not just the teacher's assigned sections
- Fix: `StudentController` and `GradeController` now scope queries to sections where `teacher_id` matches the authenticated teacher's ID

✅ **Subjects Showing TBA for Unassigned Sections** *(Fixed: Feb 2026)*
- Issue: Parent and student portals showed no teacher info when no teacher was assigned to a section
- Fix: Frontend displays "TBA" when `teacher_name` is null, preventing empty/broken UI

✅ **Welcome Page Duplicate Component** *(Fixed: Feb 22, 2026)*
- Issue: A `replace_string_in_file` operation prepended new content without removing old duplicate component (~500 lines of old code remained)
- Fix: File truncated to exact line boundary; one clean `Welcome` component remains

✅ **AppSetting::getSetting() Undefined Method** *(Fixed: Mar 2026)*
- Issue: `BadMethodCallException: Call to undefined method AppSetting::getSetting()` thrown in `StudentController`, `StudentSubjectController`, and `AppSettingsController`
- Fix: Replaced all three call sites with `AppSetting::current()->school_year ?? (date('Y').'-'.(date('Y')+1))`

✅ **Landing Page Preview Layout** *(Fixed: Mar 2026)*
- Issue: App-settings landing tab showed preview and editor in a 25/75 split that made the iframe unusable
- Fix: Restructured layout to full-width — iframe preview at top (85 vh), all editor forms (Hero, Features, Faculty, Message, Footer) stacked below in a single column

✅ **Student Dashboard Missing Pending Status UI** *(Fixed: Mar 2026)*
- Issue: Students in `pending-registrar` or `pending-accounting` status saw only the red "NOT enrolled" banner with no contextual guidance; the "Apply for Re-Enrollment" button was the only CTA and only showed for `not-enrolled`/`dropped`
- Fix: Added two conditional notice blocks — a yellow clock notice for `pending-registrar` and a blue clock notice for `pending-accounting`; the description text also becomes status-aware
